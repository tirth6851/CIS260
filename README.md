# CIS260 - Data Structures and Algorithms
**Cleveland State University**

A comprehensive Java programming repository covering fundamental and advanced computer science concepts, including data structures, algorithms, recursion, searching/sorting, collections, GUI development, and artificial intelligence.

## Course Overview

This repository contains coursework, labs, and projects from CIS260, focusing on practical implementation of core computer science concepts using Java. The curriculum emphasizes evidence-based learning strategies including spaced practice, retrieval-based exercises, and algorithm implementation from memory.

## Repository Structure

### Labs Directory
- **Zybooks/** - Interactive textbook exercises and challenges covering all course topics
- **GPT/** - AI-assisted learning projects and implementations
- **Other/** - Additional practice problems and supplementary exercises

### Wows Directory (Weekly Work)
- **ERA/** & **ERA2/** - Extended Reading Assignments focusing on algorithm analysis
- **WOW1/** & **wow2/** - Weekly programming assignments
- **cis260-02-18/** - Date-specific coursework and exercises

## Topics Covered

### Core Programming Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction
- **Data Structures** - ArrayLists, LinkedLists, HashMaps, HashSets, Stacks, Queues, TreeSets
- **Generics** - Type parameters, bounded types, generic methods and classes
- **Exception Handling** - Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, file I/O error management

### Algorithms & Analysis
- **Recursion** - Base cases, recursive thinking, factorial, Fibonacci, binary search
- **Searching Algorithms** - Linear search, binary search with complexity analysis
- **Sorting Algorithms** - Selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort
- **Big-O Notation** - Time and space complexity analysis for algorithm efficiency

### Advanced Topics
- **GUI Development** - JavaFX and Swing for building graphical interfaces
- **File I/O** - Streams, file reading/writing, formatted output with printf
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Generative AI, LLMs, chatbot integration, OpenAI API

## Learning Approach

This repository follows scientific learning strategies proven to enhance retention and mastery:

1. **Spaced Repetition** - Topics revisited across multiple labs with increasing complexity
2. **Retrieval Practice** - Algorithm implementation from memory before checking references
3. **Interleaving** - Mixed practice combining recursion, sorting, searching, and data structures
4. **Concept Contrasts** - Explicit comparisons (e.g., ArrayList vs LinkedList performance)
5. **Teach-Back Method** - Code documentation and explanation exercises

## Key Projects

### Algorithm Implementations
- Recursive algorithms (countdown, GCD, permutations)
- Custom sorting implementations with performance comparisons
- Binary search tree operations and traversals

### Data Structure Applications
- Employee management system using linked lists
- Collection framework applications (maps, sets, queues)
- Memory management demonstrations (heap vs stack)

### GUI Applications
- Salary calculators with GridPane layouts
- Interactive histograms using Canvas and GraphicsContext
- Event-driven programming with ActionListeners

## Technologies

- **Language:** Java (JDK 11+)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **GUI Frameworks:** JavaFX, Swing
- **Build Tools:** Maven/Gradle (as configured)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for chatbot development
