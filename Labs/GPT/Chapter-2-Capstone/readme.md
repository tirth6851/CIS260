# Chapter 2 Capstone – Library Management Mini Project (CIS 260)

## Description
This project is a Chapter 2 capstone lab that practices Java object-oriented programming by building a small library system using classes, constructors, getters/setters, ArrayLists, references, and static members.

## Concepts Covered
- Objects and classes
- Defining and using classes
- Private fields, mutators (setters) and accessors (getters)
- Constructors and constructor overloading
- The `this` keyword
- Objects and references
- Primitive vs reference types
- Wrapper classes (`Double`)
- `ArrayList` and the ArrayList ADT (add/get/remove/size)
- Reference-type parameters
- Static fields and methods
- Using packages/imports (standard library)

## Files
- `Book.java` – Represents a book with title, author, pages, and price.
- `Library.java` – Manages an `ArrayList<Book>` inventory and tracks total libraries created (static).
- `Main.java` – Test driver to demonstrate functionality.

## How to Run
Compile and run from the project folder:
```bash
javac *.java
java Main
